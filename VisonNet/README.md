## Polish Banknote Recognition Neural Network
In this repository you can find train_evaluate.py script to train ResNet18 based neural network to recognize polish banknotes. Also we've attached quantize.py script which helps in neural net quantization to reduce it size and give performance boost on mobile devices.
