Here you can compress images to 244:244p - linux only or docker!
Run this script:
- ffmpegCompressImages.sh - run this bash script on Linux
You should first create 2 directories / folders :
- waiting - here insert the images -they must be inside a subdirectory -  you want to be compressed
- compressed - here (inside the folder you creted for images) will be saved all compressed images
