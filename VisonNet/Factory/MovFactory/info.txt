Here you can cut the video into images (by frame) - linux only or docker!
(We used this script to create more data)
The Images are automaticly compressed (you can change veraiables inside the script)
Run this script:
-ffmpegCutnScaleMany.sh - run this bash script on Linux
You should first create 2 directories / folders :
- waiting - here insert the video you want to be cut into images
- extracted - here (inside the folder with the video name) will be saved all images from the video
