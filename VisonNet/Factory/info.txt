This is Factory directory,
dedicated to all data (image/movie) related scripts.
There are 3 different Factories: imgFactory MovFactory and rotateFactory.
Most of them require Linux to run - rotateScript uses python,
that is why there are also docker scripts, you can use to build your own container to run those scripts
Just Run DockerBuild.bat/.sh
Then DockerRun.bat/.sh
Mind that it was mostly tested on linux.
And you should have acces to the container
then run all scripts from that container (using bash)
For more info how to run specific factory go to thatFactory/info.txt

This is very usefull Linux command to bulk rename files
find . -mindepth 1 -prune -type d -exec sh -c 'd="{}"; mv -- "$d" "${d}_10"' \;
